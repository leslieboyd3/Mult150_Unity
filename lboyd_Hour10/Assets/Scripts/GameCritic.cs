/*
 * Is the game too easy or hard?
 * 
 * It is both too easy and too hard. You can win the game by doing nothing but waiting 
 * for all the colored balls to just randomly bounce around and eventually they will complete
 * the game for you. It is too hard in that the bumper is too slow and you can't really bank 
 * any shots as the chsos balls will hit your colored ball and redirect it.
 * 
 * What would make it easier or harder?
 * 
 * It there were no chaos balls or very few of them then the game would be much easier. 
 * Also, if the bumper was larger and shaped differently then you could cause different 
 * bounces that would score goals faster. 
 * If you want to make it harder then you could double the number of colored balls and 
 * chaos balls. Make the bumper move really fast and make it small so you are having to 
 * race around chasing the balls more with less control.
 * 
 * What would give it a “wow” factor?
 * 
 * I can't really think of anything that would give it a great big WOW factor. I think that if 
 * we added some really thumping music, changed the lighting, and had a leader board then 
 * it would be way cooler with a larger "wow' factor.
 * 
 * What parts of the game are fun? What parts of the game are tedious?
 * 
 * I like that the game is simple and difficult at the same time. We need to change some 
 * aspects so that it increases the fun factor. With everything being SuperBouncy then the 
 * player's skill is less impactful and it becomes more tediuos because you are actually just 
 * trying to make everything bounce more and hoping that it causes your colored balls to 
 * go into the goals. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * EXERCISE Implementations for my game:
 * 
 * Try adding a timer so that the player knows how long it took to win.
 * I added the timer code from the game manager in the "amazing runner" game.
 * 
 * Try changing the size or shape of the player’s bumper.
 * I made the bumper longer and made it move faster.
 * 
 * Try adding variations of the chaos balls.
 * I added more chaos balls that were larger and also changed all the ball speeds.
 * 
 * Try adding a chaos goal that you must bounce all the chaos balls into.
 * There is now a white chaos goal that all the chaos balls need to be bounced into.
