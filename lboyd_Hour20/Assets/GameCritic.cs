 * 1) Is the game too easy or hard? Give 2 unique reasons why it is easy or hard.
 * The game is too hard if you play it like it was designed because when you phase out to avoid 
 * the obstacles then you can't get the pick-ups either so you rapidly go through your time and
 * the game ends. Also you are bound to get slowed when you try to get all the power-ups and you 
 * can't make it from one side of the field to the other before you lose the power-up. The game
 * becomes too easy if you just focus on collecting power-ups and stay mostly in and around the
 * center of the lane and this will let you play almost for ever. Don't worry about being slowed 
 * and just keep collecting the power-ups and then you will either just let time run out because
 * you are bored or you'll hit play to stop the game because there's nothing new or exciting now.
 * 
 * 2) What 2 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?
 * I would put in two new obstacles to make the game harder and more interesting and this will
 * make the player use the phase option for real or the first new obstacle they don't avoid or
 * phase through will kill their time and end the game. The second is a large time penalty object 
 * that needs to be avoided or phased through or the player will lose 5 seconds. 
 * 
 * 3) List 2 things that would give it a "wow" factor.
 * It definetely needs some music and I would add both a chill lo-fi atmospheric piece 
 * and a thumping techno soundtrack so you have options. I think it also needs some sound
 * effects for when you get a power-up and when you collide with the obstacles.  
 * 
 * 4) What 2 parts of the game are fun? 
 * The game environment is really cool and you feel this could be an amazing endless runner with
 * some more things added. I think the phase option is a great addition but I have played the game 
 * for over 5 minutes without using it because you can almost extend your time indefinitely by just 
 * focusing on how many power-ups you can get and not worrying about being slowed. I feel that
 * the game was made this way just to excite us and make us think about how we would improve it. 
 * It gives us a great little base game but not quite enough to make it a "killer game" so that we
 * want to make it better. The phase through option would be really fun if there were other obstacles
 * that would either end your game immediately or would penalize you a big amount of seconds so that
 * the phase would now be a necessity rather that a useful option. With some additional features this
 * game would be really fun to play.
 * 
 * 5) What 2 parts of the game are tedious?
 * The obstacle is not the greatest but only a basic modified cube and the phase option isn't really 
 * needed and actually makes the game as implemented harder. Since the scenery doesn't 
 * change this means you are always running in the same place. The boredome comes because there are 
 * only two things to look for and after a while you learn to predict which ones you can't avoid or 
 * get and then your game play changes and then a few minutes later the game becomes boring. 
 * 
 * First enhancement: added backgound music so there's a good kicking beat while 
 * you run.
 * 
 * Second enhancement: added three different robots as the obstacles to avoid.
 * 
 * Third enhancement: changed the powerup to be a blue health cube shaped like a plus sign.
